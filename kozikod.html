            Kozhikode ([koːɻikːoːɖ] (About this soundlisten)), also known as Calicut, is an Indian city, second-largest urban agglomeration in the State of Kerala and 19th largest in the country with a population of 2 million according to 2011 census.[9]
            During classical antiquity and the Middle Ages, Kozhikode was dubbed the City of Spices for its role as the major trading point of Indian spices.[1] A historical city, it was the capital of an independent kingdom ruled by the Samoothiris (Zamorins) in the Middle Ages. According to data compiled by economics research firm Indicus Analytics in 2009 on residences, earnings and investments, Kozhikode ranked as the second best city in India to reside in.[10]
